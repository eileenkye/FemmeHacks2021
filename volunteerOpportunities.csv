Our program exists to supplement child life and recreational therapy programs with a quality, interactive shared theatrical experience to help alleviate stress and promote a child’s normal growth and development while in a hospital setting. Every Only Make Believe performance is interactive, meaning that the children dress up in costumes and participate as characters in the performance. Every costume for the children is decorated by OMB volunteers at Costume Collectives.</p> <p><strong>Only Make Believe can arrange a special Costume Collective volunteering opportunity for your employees in your office.</strong> At an event running approximately 1-2 hours, volunteers can join in the fun in a conference room set up with all the supplies and use their artistic, inventive, crafty skills (and Google searches!) to create one-of-a-kind costumes for our kids. Volunteers can work on one project for a few minutes or spend an hour on more elaborate projects. OMB arrives at your office with all the materials to decorate the costumes, we provide an explanation of the program and the activity, assistance and guidance as needed, and when completed, we clean up and collect all the finished costumes to take to the OMB kids.</p> <p><strong><em>Dates &amp; Time </em></strong><br /> Costume Collectives can be held on a date and time of your choosing, pending OMB’s availability. The activity works best when scheduled for 1-2 hours. OMB staff requires 30-45 minutes to set up and 15-30 minutes to clean up. For a recurring Costume Collective, OMB staff would be available as needed.</p> <p> </p>",We are looking for philanthropic-minded corporate partners to volunteer to make costumes for OMB kids to wear at the shows.

Tacked onto student loans, the textbook costs can haunt them for years.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>We Are Going to Change the Situation </strong></p> <p>Colleges and universities could greatly decrease the cost of textbooks by adopting ten measures, described in the petition below. We are leading a movement to encourage students, faculty, recent graduates, high school students, and parents to advocate for these changes.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>The Petition</strong></p> <p>Colleges and universities could save students billions of dollars a year on textbooks by adopting these policies. We call on them to:</p> <p> </p> <p>· Consider the cost when selecting textbooks.</p> <p>· Use free Open Source textbooks whenever possible.</p> <p>· Do not require university-specific editions or (unless essential) the latest edition, which undermine the used book market.</p> <p>· Refrain from requiring students to purchase expensive access codes for homework assignments and quizzes.</p> <p>· Tell students what textbooks are required and what they cost before registration begins so they have time to shop for savings.</p> <p>· Have college bookstores transparently serve students, rather than profit off of them.</p> <p>· Inform students of scholarships to fund textbooks. </p> <p>· Have college libraries put enough textbooks on reserve for in-house use.</p> <p>· Support book exchanges for students to trade used books.</p> <p>· Establish a standing student-faculty committee dedicated to this issue. </p> <p> <br /> <br /> <strong>A Nonprofit Movement</strong></p> <p>Free The Textbooks is a nonprofit movement.
